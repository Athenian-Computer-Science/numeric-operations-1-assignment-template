# Numeric Operations 1 PCA

## Problem Description
For this assignment, write a program that determines the kinetic energy of an object. Be sure to prompt the user for the mass and velocity in the appropriate units. (The units should be in the prompt, not entered by the user.)
* Ask the user for the object's mass in kg
* Ask the user for the object's velocity in meters/second.
* Calculate the kinetic energy and print a response using the format below.


### Example
* with sample user responses in ():
```
What is the mass of the object in kg? (5)
What is the object's velocity, in m/s? (10)
Output: The kinetic energy of the object is 250 Joules.
```
Be sure to follow the format of the output. Your program will not pass the tests if you use a different format.


### Submitting your assignment
* First, test your program but running it a few times. Does it work correctly? Check the formatting - are spaces and punctuation coming out in the correct places?
* When you are ready, commit and push to GitHub.
* Check the repo web page to be sure your changes are there.
* Submit "done" on Canvas.
